# C - More malloc, free

Compiled with `gcc 4.8.4`, with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` flags.

**Focus**: The project teaches about memory allocation on the heap through usage of the function `malloc`, along with the `free` function to deallocate memory. Tasks also involve researching and implementing `calloc` and `realloc`.
